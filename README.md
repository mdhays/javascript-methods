The purpose of this repository is to help myself (and anyone else who wants to) to learn and practice javascript
methods. I find that often the only real way for me to understand new concepts is to just practice until I get
it. I'll likely be updating as time goes on and we go deeper into node, so hopefully this can become a useful
resource if anyone other than myself would like to use it.
